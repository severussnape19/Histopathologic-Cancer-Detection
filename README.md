# Histopathologic Cancer Detection Ensemble

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This project tackles cancer detection in histopathology images using a powerful ensemble approach â€” combining the best of deep learning and classic machine learning to get reliable, high-performance results.

---

## Whatâ€™s inside?

- **6 different CNNs and Transformer models** trained separately on histopathology images.  
- **Ensembling of these base models** to capture diverse patterns and features.  
- **3 different meta learners** (Logistic Regression, CatBoost, XGBoost) trained on the base modelsâ€™ stacked predictions.  
- **Meta-learner ensemble** â€” combining those meta models via weighted soft voting for even better accuracy.  
- **Threshold tuning** to find the perfect balance between catching as many cancers as possible (high recall) and keeping false alarms low (high precision).  
- **Thorough evaluation** using precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

## How to use it?

1. Clone the repo.  
2. Prepare your dataset and image preprocessing pipeline.  
3. Train the 6 CNN and Transformer base models on your data.  
4. Generate meta features by stacking their predictions.  
5. Train and ensemble the 3 meta learners on these meta features.  
6. Tune classification thresholds based on your clinical priorities.  
7. Evaluate carefully on unseen test data.

## Results you can trust

- Recall ~0.99 â€” very few missed cancer cases.  
- Precision >0.96 â€” keeping false positives low.  
- F1 scores consistently near 0.98 â€” balancing precision and recall for clinical usefulness.

## Whatâ€™s next?

- Try level-2 stacking to push performance further.  
- Add explainability tools to increase clinical trust.  
- Wrap everything in an API or app for easy use by medical professionals.
